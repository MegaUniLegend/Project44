How do you plan to make your game engaging? 

The game will be fun through the difficulty. It is not meant to have a complex storyline with backtracking and filled with emotions. Instead, it is meant to be a challenge for the players to complete hard levels. This makes it fun as they have to time their jumps, listen to the rhythm to get it right and can practice. It is a great time killer.
